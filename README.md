**PipeGraph** is Python module born to expand the possibilities of [Scikit-Learn's](http://scikit-learn.org/) Pipeline by  
providing the tools needed to define more complex workflows. Using Pipeline's similar syntax, the user can encapsulate non linear sequences of transformers, estimators, predictors and even custom classes in a graph like structure.

Compatibility with Scikit-Learn's ecosystem allows the user to take advantage of interesting tools such as GridSearchCV.
